Exoplanet Transit Detection System 🌌This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Signals and Systems pipeline in MATLAB to detect exoplanetary transits using the transit photometry method2. The system simulates a star being eclipsed by an orbiting planet and extracts the planet's orbital characteristics from noisy data3.📊 Signals and Systems Concepts InvolvedThis project applies core engineering principles to astrophysical data4:Signal Detrending: Using polynomial fitting (High-Pass Filter operation) to remove low-frequency "drift" from non-stationary signals5555.Time-Domain Filtering: Applying Savitzky-Golay filters to suppress high-frequency noise while preserving the "sharp" edges (Ingress/Egress points) of the transit signal6666.Correlation & Periodicity: Utilizing the Box Least Squares (BLS) algorithm, which acts as a Matched Filter to detect periodic rectangular pulses7777.System Characterization: Mapping the "Output Signal" (detected flux) back to the "Input System" (orbital mechanics and planetary physics)8.🛠️ Modular ArchitectureThe system is built as a modular pipeline to optimize the signal at each stage9:Normalization: Converting raw flux into a relative scale centered at $1.0$10.Conditioning: Removing stellar drift (Detrending) and sensor noise (Smoothing)11.Discovery (BLS Search): Using a Modulo Operation (Phase Folding) to wrap time-series data onto itself to find periodic correlations12121212.Characterization: Converting signal depth and period into physical units using Kepler’s Third Law13131313.📐 Mathematical FoundationTo characterize the planetary system, we utilize three primary formulas14:Transit Depth ($\delta$): Relates signal loss to physical size: $\delta = (\frac{R_{planet}}{R_{star}})^{2}$15.Kepler's Third Law: Relates the detected period to the orbital semi-major axis: $a = \sqrt[3]{\frac{GM_{star}P^{2}}{4\pi^{2}}}$16.Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR): Determines the statistical significance of a detected dip: $SNR = \frac{\delta}{\sigma}\sqrt{N_{transits}}$17.💻 How to RunClone this repository.Open MATLAB and run the main script:MatlabExoplanetDetectionSystem
